# rcph_player
- this music_player is a custom player for me and that's it 

# some function to use

- add_filler() : used for adding some space
- ctr_template_scroller(['list.mp4','of.mp3','array.webm'],path,preferedname) : used for adding your own musiclist
- add_ctr_h(preferedname) : used for adding header 
- add_ctr_lists(['list.mp4','of.mp3','array.webm'],path) : used for adding 
- goAt(seconds) : equivalent of "new Audio().currentTime = seconds"

# any function that i didn't mention can be used but can be messy if you used those.
