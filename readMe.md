## rcph_player
- this music_player is a custom player for me and that's it 

## some function to use

- **add_filler()** : used for adding some space
- **ctr_template_scroller(['list.mp4','of.mp3','array.webm'],path,preferedname)** : used for adding your own musiclist
- **add_ctr_h(preferedname)** : used for adding header 
- **add_ctr_lists(['list.mp4','of.mp3','array.webm'],path)** : same as **ctr_template_scroller()**
- **goAt(seconds)** : equivalent of "new Audio().currentTime = seconds"

## find music list
